            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Ziggy's Honeyworks was born from a unique combination of passions. Our founder, Ziggy Johnson, was a software architect by profession and a beekeeper by hobby. One day, while tending to his hives in sunny Tampa, Florida, he had an epiphany: the structured efficiency of honeycomb architecture could be applied to API design.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Just as bees construct perfect hexagonal cells to maximize space and minimize material, Ziggy envisioned APIs that would efficiently handle data with minimal overhead. And just as honey flows smoothly from the comb, data would flow seamlessly between systems.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              In 2016, Ziggy left his corporate job and founded Ziggy's Honeyworks with a mission to create the most efficient, reliable API solutions in the industry. Drawing inspiration from the collaborative nature of bee colonies, he assembled a team of talented engineers who shared his vision.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Today, our growing hive of developers continues to create innovative API solutions that help businesses of all sizes integrate their systems with the same natural efficiency found in a beehive. Based in sunny Tampa, we bring a bit of Florida's warmth and brightness to every interaction.
